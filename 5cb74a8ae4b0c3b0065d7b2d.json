FGDC subcommittees and working groups, in consultation and cooperation with state, local, tribal, private, academic, and international communities, develop standards for the content, quality, and transferability of geospatial data. FGDC standards are developed through a structured process, integrated with one another to the extent possible, supportable by the current vendor community (but are independent of specific technologies), and publicly available.", "provenance": {"annotation": " ", "dateCreated": "2019-04-17T15:47:22Z", "lastUpdated": "2019-10-17T19:42:32Z"}, "hasChildren": false, "parentId":
