The US National Vegetation Classification is the US national system for vegetation classification and mapping. This package helps to manage the data for a distribution provided by the USGS.


Description
===========

This is a simple and specialized package with functions that handle getting the source data for the USNVC provided by NatureServe and housed in a ScienceBase Item into a format for distribution via a REST API. We provide it as a package in order to support full transparency on what we are doing with the data and to serve as a building block for anyone else that may want to do something similar.
